# notify-desktop-change

Simple shell script to show on-screen-display of current virtual desktop

I enjoy doing screen-share pair-programming, but it is sometimes hard for folks to follow what I'm doing as I flip between virtual desktops. I hooked up xmonad's virtual desktop change keyboard shortcuts to ALSO run this script, which in turn briefly shows a unicode-art of what virtual desktop I flipped over to. Also see my [modified version of xinerama aosd-cat](https://github.com/awwaiid/libaosd-xinerama) which this uses.
